# Filoxenia
# We're sure you've heard about how remarkably hospitable people Greeks are.
# But did you know that this hospitality traces all the way back to ancient Greece?
#  That's right, the Greeks' ancestors used to think Zeus sent strangers their way,
#  and that they had a moral obligation to offer everything they can to foreigners,
#  who were considered sacred persons. Okay, perhaps your hotel owner or stranger
#  you ask direction from on the street will not think of you as exactly sacred today,
#  but definitely they'll be really really friendly to you and treat you as a 'guest'
#  of their country. Besides, the word they use to describe their hospitality is the
#  same one Greeks used in antiquity: 'filoxenia' [filokseniːa], literally meaning
#  the state of being a friend to strangers.
